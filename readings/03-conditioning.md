## 1. Theory Theory

There is a long philosophical debate about the nature of knowledge and thought. One relatively new perspective is "Theory Theory", the proposal that knowledge looks a lot like scientific theories, and that thought involves processes very similar to reasoning about scientific theories. Read ["Reconstructing Constructivism: Causal Models, Bayesian Learning Mechanisms, and the Theory Theory"](https://insights.ovid.com/psychological-bulletin/plbul/2012/11/000/reconstructing-constructivism/4/00006823) by Alison Gopnik and Henry Wellman.

#### Reading questions:
a) In what ways are the generative models from the last two chapters in this textbook similar to the intuitive theories invoked by Theory Theory?

b) At which of Marr's levels does Theory Theory operate?

## 2. Overview of Bayesian computational models

Read "[How to Grow a Mind: Statistics, Structure, and Abstraction](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6022/1279)" by Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Charles Kemp, Thomas L. Griffiths, and Noah D. Goodman. This provides an overview of the approach taken by many of the models we'll be looking at.

#### Reading questions:
a) In what ways do the models described in this paper resemble (or not resemble) the intuitive theories invoked by Theory Theory?

b) How do Bayesian computational models differ from other kinds of reasoning systems you may be familiar with (formal logic, algebra, connectionism, deep learning, etc.)?

## Extras

* **Theory of Mind**. Theory of Mind is a paradigmatic example of a Theory Theory theory. Readers not familiar with Theory of Mind may find [this short overview useful](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f87/7e8b42c2a0ef210edff65f572dd43b2e00a8.pdf).
