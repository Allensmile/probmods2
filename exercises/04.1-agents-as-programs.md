## Exercise 1: Factors

### a)

Take our standard coin-flipping model. Use `factor` to create a "soft" condition on the outcome being heads, such that there is an approx. 95% chance of heads. 

~~~~
var dist = Infer({method: 'enumerate'},
  function () {
    var A = flip()
    factor(A) //edit this line
    return A
});
viz(dist)
~~~~

### b)

In this model, we flip 3 coins. Use `factor` to favor an outcome of 2 heads and 1 tails:

~~~~
var softHeads = Infer({ 
  model() {
    var a = flip(0.5);
    var b = flip(0.5);
    var c = flip(0.5);
    factor( \\your code here );
    return a;
  }
});

viz(softHeads);
~~~~

## Exercise 2: The Ultimatum Game

The ultimatum game requires two players: A proposer and a responder. The proposer has to decide how to allocate $10 between the two players. Once this proposal is made, the responder decides whether to accept the proposal. If the responder accepts, both players are awarded the money according to the proposal. If the responder rejects, neither player gets anything.

FUBAR - choose policy



## Exercise 3: The Prisoner's Dilemma

FUBAR - would you rather play with a maximizer or a softmaximizer?
